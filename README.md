I use to see Isamel walking down the street. 

- The idea:
* Responsable kids could use gigs to bring some money home, for example, shopping grosseries for people that have very little time.
Once they would have found a job, a reward (money) thy have one codition to keep it and is to take a couple of hours online. 
We provided the computer and space, and look for people that would like to get their services (customers)













This was the video that I made to show what the project is about : https://youtu.be/nlhIXkpiXco

Highlights of the video: 
* We look at the office.
* He talks breifly about what he studied that day. 
* Of course the video never made it because he was too shy and had to try multiple times ;) anyway I like it because is real. so here it is
