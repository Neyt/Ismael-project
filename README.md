I use to see Isamel walking down the street. 

- The idea:
* Responsable kids could use gigs to bring some money home, for example, shopping grosseries for people that have very little time.
Once they would have found a job, a reward (money) thy have one codition to keep it and is to take a couple of hours online. 
We provided the computer and space, and look for people that would like to get their services (customers)
